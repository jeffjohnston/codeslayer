The Comments plugin allows you to add and remove comments in an editor.

### Installation ###

First follow the [plugin installation](HowToInstallPlugin.md) guide.

### Features ###

The Comments plugin allows you to add and remove comments in an editor. What you do is highlight a block of text, starting from the left edge of the screen, and then press the Ctrl+/ shortcut key to comment the line or the Ctrl+Backslash shortcut key to uncomment it.

### Configuration ###

To start with you need to use the tools menu plugins dialog to configure the comments plugin.

In the Comments Configuration you need to set up the comment syntax for the file types that you want to use. In the syntax pane the end field is optional, so if you want to use a comment that does not wrap the text block just leave it blank. In the file types pane each entry can be a comma separated list of file extensions.
